        "abstract": "Visualization tools for digital cultural heritage collections allow users to discover connections between artifacts over time and across space. Created using curators' and collection stewards' unique knowledge of their collections, visualizations empower users to discover meaning and patterns within digital collections using dynamic, interactive displays. Viewshare, a free, open-source visualization platform developed by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program at the Library of Congress and its partners, is such a tool. Viewshare's primary function is as a platform for generating and customizing views that enable users to creatively experience digital cultural heritage collections. But Viewshare can also be used by institutions as a testbed for development of web requirements and as a step in the larger workflow of managing collection data and testing its potential augmentation and exhibition. This article explains the conceptual framework behind Viewshare's development and its specific functions and affordances. The article then explicates a specific, detailed use case of Viewshare by the National Gallery of Art, Gallery Archives, demonstrating both how Viewshare offers a new way for collection managers and users to understand collections and also how Viewshare can serve as a rapid prototyping tool by which content managers can refine their existing practices around digital collection management, description, and display.",

        "abstract": "Culturegraphy visualizes the exchange of cultural information over time. Treating cultural works as nodes and influences as directed edges, the visualization of these cultural networks can provide new insights into the rich interconnections of cultural development such as that seen in movie references. All findings reported in this article were made through a process that involved network scientists, a media theorist and a sociologist; the role that visualization can play in bridging scientific communities was central to this work. The visualizations were in fact the result of a process to bring researchers from different disciplines together. While traditionally physicists have used different methods than those used by media theorists or sociologists, physicists are increasingly asking questions similar to those asked by media theorists or sociologists as they study the dynamics in networks. Visualization can serve as a common language that brings fields together and identifies the differences between them but that also has its own idiosyncratic views.",

        "abstract": "Museums and galleries are becoming increasing rich in digital information. This is often created for internal activities such as cataloguing, curation, conservation and restoration, but also has many additional uses including gallery terminals, Web access, educational, scientific, and commercial licensing. New forms of multimedia content such as 3D models and virtual spaces have huge potential for enhancing the way people interact with museum collections; for example, in structured eLearning environments. Despite drivers for increased integration of information sources within the museum or gallery, and for improved Web accessibility for external users, this content is often hard to access and is held in multiple internal systems with non-standard schemas and descriptions. Providing information to external users or applications in a structured and machine-readable form is particularly difficult due to a lack of tools and standards. This makes it difficult to expose this rich source of information so it can be used over the Web in external applications. Over the past three years, the European Commission IST supported SCULPTEUR project has been addressing these problems by developing new ways to create, search, navigate, access, share, repurpose and use multimedia content over the Web for professional users. This paper describes the tools and techniques developed in the project.",

        "abstract": "Painting galleries typically provide a wealth of data composed of several data types. Those multivariate data are too complex for laymen like museum visitors to first, get an overview about all paintings and to look for specific categories. Finally, the goal is to guide the visitor to a specific painting that he wishes to have a more closer look on. In this paper we describe an interactive visualization tool that first provides such an overview and lets people experiment with the more than 41,000 paintings collected in the web gallery of art. To generate such an interactive tool, our technique is composed of different steps like data handling, algorithmic transformations, visualizations, interactions, and the human user working with the tool with the goal to detect insights in the provided data. We illustrate the usefulness of the visualization tool by applying it to such characteristic data and show how one can get from an overview about all paintings to specific paintings.",

        "abstract": "The Carnegie Museum of Art is attempting to structure provenance data so curators, scholars, and software developers can create visualizations that answer questions that would be difficult or impossible to answer without computer assistance. Provenance, the written description of the history of ownership and custody of art, is typically written as a list of the periods, places, and owners of an artwork. It captures the current best understanding of this history in a succinct and precise manner, and illustrates the gaps and uncertainties that still remain. Provenance is typically written as semi-structured text, following an institution-defined format. It would be useful to have a structured, computer-readable format for this data, allowing for search, visualization, and aggregated research. The American Alliance of Museums suggested standard, widely used across museums, is not defined with enough specificity to allow automated extraction of the structured data contained within provenance texts. Also, the provenance record model in collection management systems (CMS) is often not designed for structured data or does not provide a way to verify that the provenance text matches the structured data. A comprehensive text-based provenance standard, paired with a software library that can parse records written using this standard and convert them into structured data, would allow existing workflows to remain in place while allowing structured data to be automatically extracted from provenance records. The records could continue to be stored within existing CMS databases but contain machine-readable data for use in research and visualization. Outside of data itself, the stories these objects hold are often moving and sometimes astonishing. This ability to ask impossible questions and receive answers previously inaccessible across a museum\u2019s collection and (eventually) across many museums\u2019 collections is a resource art historians and scholars will find extremely valuable.",

        "abstract": "Conventional browsing of image collections use mechanisms such as thumbnails arranged on a regular grid or on a line, often mounted over a scrollable panel. However, this approach does not scale well with the size of the datasets (number of images). In this paper, we propose a new thumbnail-based interface to browse large collections of images. Our approach is based on weighted centroidal anisotropic Voronoi diagrams. A dynamically changing subset of images is represented by thumbnails and shown on the screen. Thumbnails are shaped like general polygons, to better cover screen space, while still reflecting the original aspect ratios or orientation of the represented images. During the browsing process, thumbnails are dynamically rearranged, reshaped and rescaled. The objective is to devote more screen space (more numerous and larger thumbnails) to the parts of the dataset closer to the current region of interest, and progressively lesser away from it, while still making the dataset visible as a whole. During the entire process, temporal coherence is always maintained. GPU implementation easily guarantees the frame rates needed for fully smooth interactivity.",

        "abstract": "The Australian Prints and Printmaking website (printsandprintmaking.gov.au) provides a gateway for information on printed images from Australia and Pacific region. The website contains rich data on more than 48,000 works,  20,000 artists, 8000 exhibitions, 3000 galleries and over 9000 associated references. The works are predominantly from the National Gallery of Australia\u2019s collection. Access to this vast collection has traditionally been through a search based interface. This paper will present a set of recently launched experimental interfaces that encourage open-ended exploration within this collection. These novel web based tools aim to support exploration, discovery and interpretation in this culturally significant collection. They draw upon previous work with archival and museum collections and demonstrate alternatives to the dominant search-based paradigm of collection access. These tools encourage discovery by emphasising relationships within the collection and providing displays that are denser and richer than conventional web pages. In setting out to create rich visual interfaces to a large digital collection, the project uncovers a number of challenges and considerations. It operates in a field between dynamic web design and online visualisation, where techniques and practices are still forming. A \u201cdata dense\u201d display challenges conventions of API development, while delivering in the browser presents both opportunities and risks. This work is part of a conceptual context that Mitchell Whitelaw characterises as \u2018generous interfaces\u2019. Whitelaw argues that \u2018the task-based paradigm embedded in information retrieval is increasingly out of step with our ever-more-ubiquitous, casual, and everyday experiences of information systems\u2019. This view is shared by Marian D\u00f6rk, who introduced the \u2018Information Flaneur\u2019 model as an alternative approach to task-based information seeking, one that leads to more positive information experiences. The \u2018information flaneur\u2019 is able to curiously and critically move through information landscapes and creatively construct meaning as they go. The leisurely curiosity of information seeking is increasingly important and we value play and pleasure in support of engagement and discovery.",

An initial experiment involved the collection and visualization of connections between cultural digital resources - and their providers - stored in the platform DiCet (an Italian Living Lab centred on Cultural Heritage and Technology). This step helped to identify the most appropriate relational data model to use for the social network visualization phase. We then run a second experiment using a web application designed to extract relevant data from the platform Europeana.eu. The actors in our two-mode networks are Cultural Heritage Objects (CHOs) shared by institutional and individual providers, such as galleries, museums, individual experts and content aggregators. The links connecting nodes represent the digital resources associated to the CHOs. The application of the prototype offers insights on the most prominent providers, digital resources and cultural objects over time. Through the application of semantic analysis, we were also able to identify the most used words and the related sentiment associated to them.",

The system exploits an innovative image browsing paradigm and image retrieval functionalities to perform natural and intuitive user interaction: users can explore the image database by handling digital pictures by means of touch gestures or by the use of a predetermined set of physical objects,  once one of these objects is placed on the table, it is automatically recognized and the associated function is triggered. The set of objects and the function associations can be dynamically configured. An innovative feature of our application is that users can interactively create and manipulate image clusters where images are grouped according to their pictorial similarity. This is achieved by placing one or more specific tangible objects on the table surface. The system has been evaluated on a collection of photos organized in groups according to the UNESCO picture categories. The usability tests, performed considering different user categories, show that users consider the application to be attractive and interesting.",

On a light box, they can place slides or printed images, move the images around at will, group them as desired, and visually compare them. The transition to digital images has rendered this workflow obsolete. Now, art historians lack well-designed, unified interactive software tools that effectively support the operations they perform with physical light boxes. To address this problem, we designed ARIES (ARt Image Exploration Space), an interactive image manipulation system that enables the exploration and organization of fine digital art. The system allows images to be compared in multiple ways, offering dynamic overlays analogous to a physical light box, and supporting advanced image comparisons and feature-matching functions, available through computational image processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system to support art historians tasks through real use cases.",

        "abstract": "Digital collections interfaces have been traditionally designed for audiences with an established interest and motivation to probe the collection for specific objects. There are still relatively few user-centric interfaces that encourage casual browsing and a greater exploration of collections from a broader cross-section of the public. In 2014\u20132015, supported by the Digital R\\&D Fund for the Arts, Tyne \\& Wear Archives \\& Museums (TWAM) undertook a digital research and development project with Microsoft Research and Newcastle University to explore the following question: \u201cCan cultural organisations with a digital collection improve public access and engagement with their online collection through the adoption of Web interfaces and systems that more creatively provoke and respond to an audience's exploration of content?\u201d A user-centric collections interface was developed to explore this, and a software development kit was produced to allow the wider heritage sector to adopt the system for their own collections. Ongoing user research and evaluation informed every stage of the system\u2019s development and yielded key insights that recommended new directions for TWAM and potentially the wider sector. This paper will explore the results and contextualise them against typical online collection formats and their perceived limitations, as well as other research in the field. It will investigate the public impact of an interface designed to inspire prolonged and open-ended browse, rather than enable directed text search. This paper will argue that there are clear opportunities to deeply engage audiences, which have limited knowledge and inclination to search object catalogues, with visual collections interfaces that manufacture a public interest in \"discovering the unknown.\" As well as recommending design methodologies for developing digital collections, this paper will also ask questions about how this gathered intelligence can positively influence the practice of the museu",

        "abstract": "A Web site, in all domains and in cultural heritage in particular, is meant to support a variety of communication goals, like providing practical information, offering an \u201cat a glance\u201d understanding of what the permanent collections are about, supporting a pleasant and enticing exploration, allowing the user to locate a specific piece of content, as well as promoting the institution\u2019s brand, some selected pieces of content (shop-window effect), etc. As long as the site is small, \u201ctraditional\u201d information architecture can cope with these needs. But when the site gets large and information-intensive, the traditional structure starts \u201ccracking\u201d as layers upon layers of navigation are added, and disappointment becomes a common user experience. Straight search engines have provided a reasonable solution to support just one of the above goals: allowing the user to locate a specific piece of content. In this paper we illustrate how Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), combining lightweight information architecture with advanced search paradigms (like faceted search) and interactive visualization strategies, can be used to better support a number of communication goals. The examples are taken from the new Web site for the Directorate General of Antiquity of the Italian Ministry for Culture Heritage (to become public in Autumn 2010), where both a huge amount of content (the Italian archeological heritage) and a variety of users\u2019 profiles (from scholars to amateurs and tourists) are managed.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade, cultural heritage has moved toward the encoding of information in semantic format. Ontologies make the description of artworks clearer, unambiguous and often self-explanatory, with advantages in terms of interoperability. In cultural heritage, the current shift toward semantic encoding opens the way to the creation of interfaces that allow the users to orientate themselves easily in media repositories through a visual representation of their properties and relationships. In order to illustrate this approach, we describe a case study in ontologies and visualization for cultural heritage, Labyrinth. In Labyrinth, the user is immersed in a 3D labyrinth where turning points and paths represent a set of cultural artifacts and the semantic relations holding among them.",

However, it is the often comprehensive and complex nature of collections that can make it difficult to gain a sense of overview and orientation. We present the outcomes of two design studies, one engaging with an aggregated collection from diverse cultural institutions, and the other focusing on the specific features of a collection of school books. Both design studies involved iterative design processes with the collection owners leading to prototypical implementations of multiple aesthetically and interactively coordinated visualizations. The resulting representations are experimental, yet playful overviews of the temporal and spatial distribution of objects and the associated topics, people, and organizations. In our presentation we discuss our method of involving collection owners into the design process, present the diverse resulting interactive visualizations, and discuss the two information architectures integrating the multiple views.",

We illustrate the potential of Indiana Finder in the context of the digital protection and conservation of rock art natural and cultural heritage sites. In this domain, Indiana Finder provides an integrated environment that archaeologists can exploit to investigate, discover, and learn from textual documents, pictures, and drawings related to rock carvings.

While the majority of these focused on traditional 2D methods of display, some did introduce the application of 3D visualization metaphors. Such environments were, however, usually tailored to a specific collection or topic, such as a featured artist or epoch. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of valuable metadata resources has opened up the perspective for the automatic creation of such 3D environments by integrating semantic data sources through the Web. In this work we therefore present a prototype that automatically constructs a 3D environment from semantic art history related Web resources, offering users the opportunity to explore art history following the visualized structure of relations between historical actors of the field. Traversing this historical social network enables users to encounter previously unknown artists and their work in a serendipitous way.",

With regards to the specific character of cultural heritage at the intersection of research, education, and public interest, the presented visualization environment aims at meeting the requirements of both researchers as well as a broader public. We present the results from a collaborative interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation, art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled with a more qualitative mode that allows for detailed examination of the artifacts and their contexts by displaying high-resolution views of digitized cultural objects with detailed art historical research findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the resulting visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of a collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and the feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the resulting prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of transferability of carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated visualizations of cultural heritage and raise questions concerning the applicability of our approach to related strands of humanities research.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we exemplify how information visualization supports speculative thinking, hypotheses testing, and preliminary interpretation processes as part of literary research. While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result-vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.",

        "abstract": "Digital information displays are becoming more common in public spaces such as museums, galleries, and libraries. However, the public nature of these locations requires special considerations concerning the design of information visualization in terms of visual representations and interaction techniques. We discuss the potential for, and challenges of, information visualization in the museum context based on our practical experience with EMDialog, an interactive information presentation that was part of the Emily Carr exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. EMDialog visualizes the diverse and multi-faceted discourse about this Canadian artist with the goal to both inform and provoke discussion. It provides a visual exploration environment that offers interplay between two integrated visualizations, one for information access along temporal, and the other along contextual dimensions. We describe the results of an observational study we conducted at the museum that revealed the different ways visitors approached and interacted with EMDialog, as well as how they perceived this form of information presentation in the museum context. Our results include the need to present information in a manner sufficiently attractive to draw attention and the importance of rewarding passive observation as well as both short- and longer term information exploration.",

        "abstract": "Visualisation of complex datasets is often designed to assist communication and to make that data more visually accessible (Friendly and Denis, 2006). In some recent approaches to data visualisation, the goal of visualising datasets is not to reveal a single underlying 'truth' that hides in complex data, but rather to visualise the structure of the data itself, to 'show everything' and see what emerges (Jones, 2009). The latter approach is particularly useful in the visualisation of large digital heritage collections, which present challenges for conventional data visualisation because they are often polymorphous and idiosyncratic. Interactive tools for exploring heritage datasets can enable people to explore and play with potential relationships between parts of the collection and to learn about the collection itself and thus better understand the material it contains and how that material has been organised. This paper provides a tangible demonstration of this approach and how it has been embraced in two recent interactive heritage collection visualisation projects: Whitelaw's Visible Archive (which visualises the collection of the National Archives of Australia) and Hinton and Whitelaw's Flickr Commons Explorer (which visualises nearly 40 photographic collections comprising more than 20,000 images available through Flickr).",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for the visualization and exploration of items associated with multi-value attributes for which there is overlap of attribute values across the data set. ArchivesZ is a prototype featuring this method and has been designed to support exploration of the metadata describing archival collections. Archival materials are unique and organized into groups, usually based on who created the materials. These groups may vary in size from a small number of folders to many hundreds of boxes. When describing archival materials, archivists note the range of years covered by the records, the size of the collection and the high level subjects of the records. One common metric for communicating the size of a collection is linear feet. A single linear foot is one foot of shelf space occupied by records. ArchivesZ leverages a unique dual sided histogram to support exploration of the multiple subjects assigned to each collection. It combines the dual sided histogram with a more traditional histogram displaying year data to permit tightly coupled, multi-dimensional browsing of subject and time period metadata. By representing the distribution of subjects and time periods using the metric of total aggregate linear feet of associated collections, ArchivesZ permits users to get a better sense of total available research materials than they would by viewing a standard search result list",

Developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration of computer scientists, historians, HCI researchers and interface designers, the tool aims at supporting historians in the discovery and historical analysis of relationships between people, places and events. A special focus is on the identification and interactive visualization of social relations from historical photo collections through a combination of automatic analysis and expert-based crowd sourcing. The tool design bridges the gap between established network analysis and visualization techniques and traditional hermeneutic research methods in historical research. It integrates visual exploration with hybrid social graph construction, hypothesis formulation and the consultation of digitized primary sources. A formative evaluation of the current prototype, developed as a domain-specific application for historians in the field of European integration points to opportunities and critical factors in applying this approach to support and further current research practices in digital humanities.",

The distance function, the clustering and the projection methods run so fast that they can calculate new results during the interaction with the user and can therefore be adapted dynamically to the context of the investigation and the requests made by the user at any given moment. The system aims to facilitate investigations which take similarity between images in terms of human perception into account. Similarity in terms of human perception is highly context and task dependent and cannot be described by a metric in the mathematical sense. Functions reflecting similarity in terms of human perception have to be adapted dynamically to the context of the investigation as well as to the tasks assigned at any given time. Our system thus shows that these requirements can be met in principle, and we propose it as a basis for developing specific applications and suitable surfaces in collaboration with experts for whom such tools are useful, as for instance experts of art theory.\",",

Rooms organization is not predefi-ned but defined incrementally by taking into account not only the relationships between objects, but also the users centers of interest. The latter are evaluated in real-time through user interactions within the virtual museum. This interface allows for a personal reading and favors the discovery of unsuspec-ted links between data.

        "abstract": "The digitization of museum collections has the potential not only to make them accessible remotely but also to augment their in-situ exploration at the gallery. We are interested in how mobile visual interfaces to museum collections can enhance explorations and experiences of the collection insitu, and how these in-situ explorations compare to remote browsing of collections, e.g., through web-based interfaces. We discuss findings from a study where potential visitors explored a museum collection using a tablet-based visualization remotely, at first, and then as part of their museum visit. Our findings show that the entry points to the collection differ in the two different contexts: while overview visualizations linked with individual artifacts triggered curiosity and promoted exploration in the remote setting, it was the individual (physical) artifacts that drove explorations of the mobile visualization in-situ. While remote explorations of the visualization can be characterized as highly open-ended, in-situ, people approached the interface in a more targeted way. These findings suggest an item-centric approach to the design of mobile visualizations that bridges the physical and digital information space to assist in-situ explorations of museums collections.",

Peripleo enables users to explore the geographic, temporal and thematic composition of distributed digital collections in their entirety, and then to progressively filter and drill down to explore individual records. We provide an overview of Peripleo\u2019s features, and present the underlying technical architecture. Furthermore, we discuss how datasets that differ vastly in terms of size, content type and theme can be made uniformly accessible through a set of lightweight metadata conventions we term ``connectivity through common references''. Our current demo installation links approximately half a million records from 25 datasets. These datasets originate from a spectrum of sources, ranging from the small personal photo collection with 35 records, to the large institutional database with 134.000 objects. The product of research in the Andrew W. Mellon-funded Pelagios 3 project, Peripleo is Open Source software.",

        "abstract": "Despite advancing search technologies, information overload has not yet been solved. Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes increasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose Facets cape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the Facets cape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space.",

In this paper, we formalize and generalize DL exploring services within a DL theory. We develop theorems to indicate that browsing and searching can be converted or mapped to each other under certain conditions. The theorems guide the design and implementation of exploring services for an integrated archaeological DL, ETANA-DL. Its integrated browsing and searching can support users in moving seamlessly between these operations, minimizing context switching, and keeping users focused. It also integrates browsing and searching into a single visual interface for DL exploration. A user study to evaluate ETANA-DL's exploring services helped validate our hypotheses.",

We suggest that serendipity can be facilitated through visualization. To explore this, we introduce the Bohemian Bookshelf, which aims to support serendipitous discoveries in the context of digital book collections. The Bohemian Bookshelf consists of five interlinked visualizations each offering a unique overview of the collection. It aims at encouraging serendipity by (1) offering multiple visual access points to the collection, (2) highlighting adjacencies between books, (3) providing flexible visual pathways for exploring the collection, (4) enticing curiosity through abstract, metaphorical, and visually distinct representations of books, and (5) enabling a playful approach to information exploration. A deployment at a library revealed that visitors embraced this approach of utilizing visualization to support open-ended explorations and serendipitous discoveries. This encourages future explorations into promoting serendipity through information visualization.",

        "abstract": "Information technology, through the advances provided by computational linguistics and related disciplines, has opened the door to previously unthinkable possibilities of study in linguistics. The wealth and diversity of sources that is now available is fundamental to the understanding of language evolution and dictionary-making. However, these advancements are paired with a paradigm shift, in which both the user needs and the modes in which the users interact with technology have changed so much and so rapidly, that modern lexicography would need to resort to a new generation of tools to support its tasks. We present our work developed for the Nuevo Diccionario Hist\\'{o}rico del Espa\u00f1ol (NDHE), in which the challenges of enabling deeper insight and supporting new user's tasks in diachronic linguistics have been approached from a human-computer interaction perspective. Thus, in contrast to what has happened in other disciplines in which visual analytics has focused its efforts since earlier, the analysis tools that are made now in the hands of the experts usually provide a volume of raw data so vast, that the data themselves can greatly hinder the work of experts. The linguistics community has already recognized the key importance of user-friendly interfaces. However, neither more powerful tools (in terms of automatic processing) nor user-friendliness alone are sufficient to support typical analytical tasks that take out the most from the multidimensional and ever-growing data stored in corpora and dictionaries. This paper discusses the benefits of producing corpus and dictionary analysis tools that go beyond user-friendliness and presents, interactive visual analysis tools produced for the NDHE and its sources.",

To date, the process of analyzing a collection\u2014from data gathering to exploratory analysis and final conclusions\u2014has largely been conducted using linear review and pen and paper methods. To help curators analyze large-scale digital collections, we developed an interactive visual analytics application. We have put methods in place to summarize large and diverse information about the collection and to present it as integrated views. Multiple views can be linked or unlinked on demand to enable curators to identify trends and particularities at different levels of detail and to compare and contrast views. We describe two analysis workflows to illustrate how the application can be used to triage digital collections and facilitate collection management decision making and to provide access. After conducting a focus group study with domain specialists, we introduced features to address their concerns and needs.",
